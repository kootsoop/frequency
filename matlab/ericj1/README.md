| [genivect.m](https://github.com/kootsoop/frequency/blob/main/matlab/ericj1/genivect.m)     | Generates a length N interpolating vector using the dot product algorithm. vectst.m demonstrates the use and performance of this method, and intrpltr.mcd contains the derivation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [inttst2.m](https://github.com/kootsoop/frequency/blob/main/matlab/ericj1/inttst2.m)       | Analyzes the performance of two comparable peak location estimators: Quinn's method, and a quadratic fit interpolator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [quadterp.m](https://github.com/kootsoop/frequency/blob/main/matlab/ericj1/quadterp.m)     | The quadratic fit interpolator. Performance of this algorithm is analyzed by inttst2.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [quinn.m](https://github.com/kootsoop/frequency/blob/main/matlab/ericj1/quinn.m)           | Quinn's estimator. Performance of this algorithm is analyzed by inttst2.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [vectst.m](https://github.com/kootsoop/frequency/blob/main/matlab/ericj1/vectst.m)         | Analyzes the performance of three methods of interpolating simple interbin samples (as opposed to estimating the peak location). Performance is compared among a DFT of 2 times the reference length, 2 times interpolation by zero filling the inverse transform, and use of the dot product interpolator generated by genivect.m and derived in intrpltr.mcd to interpolate a single interbin sample. |
| [Intrpltr.mcd](https://github.com/kootsoop/frequency/blob/main/matlab/ericj1/Intrpltr.mcd) | A MathCAD file illustrating the derivation of the dot product interpolator analyzed in vectst.m. This document was originally written for technical types with non-rigorous mathematical or non-DSP background, so the derivation may be more explicit than usual to some.                                                                                                                              |

The files inttst.m and vectst.m are fairly configurable and contain some switches to do such things as turn noise on and off, etc. They are reasonably well commented and it is hoped that users adept at matlab will not have too much trouble using or adapting them.
inttst2.m uses Hanning.m from the Signal Processing Toolbox. If you do not have the Signal Processing Toolbox, the Hanning window is merely:

Hanning(n) = 0.5 * (1 - cos(2*pi\*n/N))

where N is the length of the window.

The output rms error values for the frequency interpolation are in units of DFT bins.
