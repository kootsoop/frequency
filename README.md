# frequency
Some frequency estimation stuff in Matlab, mostly from the CRC for Robust and Adaptive Systems

This site presents some [Matlab (tm)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mathworks.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEN8sEnpi2M6VohHRH2Q4pK9OZEUA) code for estimation of the frequency of a single, constant tone in noise. While these methods may be extended to the multiharmonic and multi-tone cases, these programs do not include this extension. 
Currently no explanations for the algorithms are available in HTML form. The only on-line reference is [here (PDF)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fespace.library.uq.edu.au%2Fview%2FUQ%3A10626&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFGDc6N8gt32C3HAVY8n7mUlY8BCg). The reference list from this, with some linking of authors, is available here in HTML form.

Professor Barry Quinn has recently completed a book on this topic:

Quinn, B.G, Hannan, E.J. (2000) “[The Estimation and Tracking of Frequency](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge.org%2Fuk%2Fcatalogue%2Fcatalogue.asp%3Fisbn%3D0521804469&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFIMBThtqEYttxzyJD3-31pxIoZ6Q)”  

Barry has made matlab code for the algorithms he describes in the book available here.
